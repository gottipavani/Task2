Description Of My Project REST API CLIENT :In this task, I developed a Java-based REST API Client using Apache HttpClient for making HTTP requests and Jackson for parsing JSON responses.
The objective was to consume a public API, process the response, and display the output in a structured and readable format.

Implementation Details
Dependencies Used (added in pom.xml):
Apache HttpClient → To establish an HTTP connection and send a GET request to the API.
Jackson Databind → To parse and extract values from the JSON response.

API Used:
A free public API: Official Joke API. This API provides random jokes in JSON format without requiring an API key.
